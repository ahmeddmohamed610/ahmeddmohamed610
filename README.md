### 🚀 DevOps Engineer | 🐧 Linux Enthusiast | 🏗️ Home Lab Builder | 🌐 Networking Fan  

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a DevOps engineer who loves building, breaking, and optimizing systems — whether it’s in production or my ever-growing home lab.  
I’m passionate about Linux, automation, infrastructure, and anything that helps systems run smoother and smarter.

## 🐧 **Linux & Unix Passion**
I’m happiest on the command line.

- Managing users, groups, permissions
- Fixing what can't be fixed
- Hardening systems
- Automating tasks
- Running and maintaining my own Proxmox lab

## 🏠 **Home Lab Playground**
Outside of work, I run a full lab environment where I experiment with:
- Proxmox clusters running VMs & containers  
- Wazuh agents on each server - to collect and analyze
- OPNsense with VLANs, IPS/IDS (Snort/Suricata)  
- Docker & Kubernetes clusters  
- Pi-hole + Unbound for network-wide DNS filtering  
- Uptime Kuma monitoring  
- And a bunch of testing servers — because why not?

## 🏅 **A Bit About Me**
- Former **kickboxing champion** (K1 & Muay Thai) — discipline and resilience included  
- Big fan of **jogging** and **swimming**  
- Love building things that work, and fixing things that don’t
